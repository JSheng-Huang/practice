"""Minimum Partition
Problem:
        Given a set of non-negative integers, the task is to divide it into two 
    sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is 
    minimum. 
        If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m 
    elements, Subset2 must have `n - m` elements and the value of abs(sum
    (Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.
Example:
    Input: arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5} 
    Output: 1
    Explanation:
        Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12
        Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11    
Refer to: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/partition-a-set-into-two-subsets-such-that-the-difference-of-subset-sums-is-minimum/
Time Complexity: 
        O(n * sum), where `n` is the number of elements and `sum` is the sum of 
    all elements.
Space Complexity: O(sum).
